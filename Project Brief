You're the best coder and UI UX designer in the world! --- I want to create a Obsidian replica - an app with a markdown editor, bullets, hierarchies, page and block hierarchies, daily notes, page backlinks, block references. Use local markdown files for storing. I additionally want to have a audio recording feature (exactly how OBS does it - recording audio from the mic as well as the audio coming from the desktop. system and works seamlessly as the output/ input devices change), now this audio must also be stored in the database and must me tagged to the page it was written in, additionally, the exact audio timestamp must be tagged to the block (determined by the bullet hierarchy) from when the bullet/ block was created - so ultimately I should have a small play button next to the bullet to play the audio from wherever that particular block was made.; the audio functionality I described is currently there in microsoft's one note. A couple of additional things - keep the UI clean and modern (replicate Obsidian's beautiful clean UI), don't have to do any of the authentication things, can be a single user environment.Preferred stack UI - React, Tauri, Tailwind; Audio recorder Rust (CPAL) or FFmpeg backend; Playback HTML5 audio + timestamp; Packaging - Tauri desktop app; Editor - Lexical. Output should be the complete codebase that I can download locally and begin execution.  Every line of code should be complete and production ready! If you fail, you DIE
